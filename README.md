Icons used in Google Apps Script add-ons developped by Facts Haven SAS.

All these icons have been developped "by hand" and are ⓒ Facts Haven SAS 2026 and beyond.

Note that the dash in their names is not a dash but a ￚ character which is legal within javascript identifiers.

The source file is a keynote presentation. Once ok, we print it to PDF (scalable) and then we generate a PNG with 72dpi resolution so that one pixel in the keynote matches one pixel in the output file.

Then we make the neighbourghood of the icon transparent and we crop it to 64 by 64 pixels.

Source files are kept in the icon-sources .folder.
